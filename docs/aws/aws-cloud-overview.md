## AWS Cloud Overview

### Region

    1. A region is a cluster of Data Centers.
    2. Most AWS services are region-scoped.

### How to choose an AWS Region

    1. Comliance - if it needs to keep data within same region
    2. Proximity - closer to the main user base
    3. Available Service
    4. Pricing

### Availibility Zones

    1. Each region has multiple AZ's (usually 3, min 3, max 6)
    2. Each AZ has one or more discrete data centers.
    3. Separate from each other, means isolated from disasters.

### Edge Locations

    1. 400+ points of presence/edge locations, in 90+ cities across 40+ countries.
    2. Like CDN, deliver content to end user with low latency.
